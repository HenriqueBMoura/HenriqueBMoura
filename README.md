# Henrique Moura

Senior Frontend Engineer · Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) · Frontend Architecture

I build and maintain production-grade frontend systems for enterprise and regulated environments, where frontend decisions directly affect performance, accessibility, and system reliability.

My work usually sits between architecture and execution. I collaborate closely with design and product teams to turn complex requirements into interfaces that are practical, maintainable, and resilient in real-world conditions. I also integrate third-party APIs, including AI-powered services, with attention to UX, latency, and failure scenarios.

## Areas of focus

- Frontend architecture with React, Next.js, and TypeScript  
- Accessibility-first systems (WCAG 2.1 AA)
